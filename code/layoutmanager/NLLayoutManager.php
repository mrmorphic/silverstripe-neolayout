     *		- "styles" - maps to a map of style definitions that are aggregated into the style attribute
     *			of the container.

     *			shouldn't include "class" or "style" keys. Values should not be quoted.
     * Typically, the layout manager will use the layoutValues property, which are specific to the layout manager,
     * to determine what extra classes to add.
