/**
 * NLComponent is the base class for all objects that can appear in an NLView. This holds common behaviour of
 * all components, and includes a factory method for constructing an NLComponent hierarchy given a raw object
 * representation.
 *
 * The serialised form of a component tree is represented as a json expression. e.g.:
 * {
 *     "ClassName": "NLVerticalBoxLayout",
 *     "children": [
 *         { "ClassName": "NLTextComponent", "Text": "Some text" }
 *     ],
 *     "bindings": {
 *         "myproperty": {}
 *     },
 *     "layout": {
 *         (layout properties defined by the layout manager/parent)
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * There is a relationship between properties and bindings. Properties are defined per class.
 *
 * Thoughts on field definition and binding:
 * - each property has a name, and specifies the class name of a DBField-derivative.
 * - binding is performed on demand.
 * - the binding process iterates over the defined properties, and creates an instance of the datatype
 *   specified for that property. It calculates the value by examining the bound value. It evaluates that within
 *   the context, and assigns it to the value property of the field object in the binding.
 * - then rendering takes place.
 * - there needs to be a syntax in the serialised NLComponent for the binding. Probably an object that defines
 *   the place where the value comes from.
 * - bindings are assumed to be bidirectional, so that a user may edit a component and expect the value to be saved
 *   back to the context.
 * - some bindings may be unidirectional (readony). The context will define this in its metadata.
 * - the context object may provide a getViewMetadata() method, which will return a map containing what can be
 *   bound to. It would be great if this metadata is expressed in terms also of SS data types, so for example nested
 *   objects can be returned.
 * - there needs to be a way for a component to bind to values that are stored directly in the component. This will need
 *   to have very robust serialisation as it may include rich text.
